This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to division by zero. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. The bug occurs when either of the inputs is 0. The function incorrectly returns 0 instead of handling the division by zero scenario gracefully.  The solution uses a check to ensure neither value is 0 and handles the case appropriately.
